# Passport.js Authentication Module

This project is a user authentication module using Passport.js, a popular authentication middleware for Node.js. It uses a local strategy, meaning that it checks the credentials (username and password) against a local database.

## Code Explanation

The code is divided into several parts:

1. **Dependencies**: The code requires `passport`, `passport-local`, `bcrypt`, and a helper module. `passport` is the main authentication library, `passport-local` is a strategy for authenticating with a username and password, `bcrypt` is used for password hashing, and the helper module is a custom module for database operations.

2. **Passport Strategy**: The code sets up a local strategy for Passport. It takes a username and password, and uses the helper module to find a user with the given username. If the user is found, it compares the provided password with the hashed password in the database using `bcrypt`. If the passwords match, the user is authenticated.

3. **Serialization and Deserialization**: Passport needs to serialize and deserialize user instances to support login sessions. Serialization determines what data of the user object should be stored in the session. The result of the serializeUser method is attached to the session as `req.session.passport.user = {}`. Deserialization is the opposite operation, where it takes the ID and looks up the user in the database, attaching it to the `req.user`.

## Usage

To use this module, you need to have a user model with at least a username and password, and helper functions `findByUsername` and `findById` for fetching user data from your database. The helper functions should be defined in the `helper` module.

This module should be integrated into an Express.js application, and the Passport middleware should be used in your routes that require authentication.

## Note

This module does not handle user registration, password reset, email verification, or any other features commonly associated with user accounts. It only handles user authentication.
